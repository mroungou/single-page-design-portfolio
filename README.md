## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to further develop my JS skills. I struggled a bit to get the carousel working. It works but not perfect. I would like to make it smoother.
